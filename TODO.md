# Berrima Diesel Touring Tools - Development Log & TODO

## Last Session

- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Summary:** VIC Servo Saver API fully integrated, deployed, and LIVE! 🎉
- **Key achievements:**
  - ✅ Received VIC Servo Saver API key (`892b24b117ea6ae7c95f356035b04d16`)
  - ✅ Reviewed full API documentation PDF (29 pages)
  - ✅ Created `vicFuelApi.js` service with complete integration
  - ✅ Implemented UUID v4 transaction ID generation for request tracing
  - ✅ Implemented client-side distance calculation (API returns all VIC stations)
  - ✅ Added 1-hour caching strategy (data has 24h delay)
  - ✅ Implemented rate limit handling (10 requests per 60 seconds)
  - ✅ Integrated VIC into `nationalFuelApi.js`
  - ✅ Updated STATE_CONFIG to mark VIC as available
  - ✅ Added CC-BY-4.0 attribution footer for all state data sources
  - ✅ Added API documentation PDF to `.gitignore`
  - ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow with VIC API key
  - ✅ Added `VITE_VIC_FUEL_API_KEY` to GitHub Secrets
  - ✅ Updated README with new coverage stats (8,300+ stations)
  - ✅ Successfully deployed to production via GitHub Actions
- **Commits pushed:** 4 commits (VIC integration, attribution footer, workflow update, README update)
- **Coverage increased:** 5 states → 6 states (NSW, ACT, QLD, VIC, WA, TAS)
- **Station count:** 5,000+ → 8,300+ stations (66% increase!)
- **Stopped at:** VIC integration LIVE at https://scottleimroth.com/berrima-diesel-app/
- **Blockers:**
  - SA: Register as data publisher via CBS/Informed Sources (free, contact cbs.sa.gov.au or informedsources.com/contact/)
  - NT: MyFuelNT still showing errors, no usable public API
  - WA FuelWatch has no CORS headers — using allorigins.win proxy (may be unreliable)
- **Next steps:**
  - Manually verify VIC integration on live site
  - Start SA API registration process
  - Monitor VIC API rate limits and performance

## Current Status

### Working Features
- **Diesel Price Finder** — National diesel prices covering NSW (3,200+ stations, real-time), ACT (via NSW), QLD (1,500+ stations, monthly), VIC (2,000+ stations, 24h delayed), WA (500+ stations, daily), TAS (75+ stations, real-time). Total: 8,300+ stations across 6 states/territories! State selector, map/list views, price alerts, bookmarks, radius filter, data attribution footer.
- **4WD, Caravan & Motorhome Route Planner** — HERE Routing API with weight-aware routing (works nationally), vehicle presets, avoid options, fuel consumption calc, turn-by-turn, saved routes
- **PWA** — Installable on Android/iOS, offline caching, fullscreen mode
- **GitHub Pages Deployment** — Auto-deploys on push to main via GitHub Actions

### Known Issues
- HERE Autosuggest API returns 400 errors sometimes (geocoding fallback works)
- Some FuelCheck station prices may be weeks old (data quality issue upstream)

## Architecture & Decisions

| Decision | Reason | Date |
|----------|--------|------|
| PWA over native APK | All features require internet for APIs; no value in native shell | 2026-02-04 |
| Diesel fuel types only | App is for Berrima Diesel Service — exclusively diesel since 1956 | 2026-02-04 |
| localStorage for user data | No backend server; keeps app simple and private | 2026-01 |
| Open-Meteo over BOM direct | Free, no auth, structured JSON, uses BOM data under the hood | 2026-02-04 |
| OSM Overpass for campgrounds | Free, comprehensive, no auth, community-maintained | 2026-02-04 |
| Phase 1 priority: national prices | Most requested feature gap; builds on existing fuel tracker | 2026-02-04 |
| allorigins.win CORS proxy for WA | FuelWatch has no CORS headers; free proxy is simplest for static site | 2026-02-04 |
| QLD CKAN DataStore over CSV | SQL queries via API; no need to download/parse full CSV files | 2026-02-04 |
| TAS FuelCheck direct API | Discovered TAS has its own FuelCheck API with CORS; no V2 auth needed | 2026-02-04 |
| SA via fuelprice.io (future) | SA has no public gov API; Informed Sources aggregator is private | 2026-02-04 |
